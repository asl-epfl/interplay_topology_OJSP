This code can be used to generate simulations similar to Figs. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 and Table 1 in the following paper:

Vincenzo Matta, Virginia Bordignon, Augusto Santos, Ali H. Sayed, "Interplay Between Topology and Social Learning Over Weak Graphs", IEEE Open Journal of Signal Processing, 2020.

Figs. 2, 3 and 4 are generated executing file 'codefig234.py' with arguments 2, 3 or 4 respectively. For example, to generate Fig. 2, execute the following commands in the terminal:
$ python codefig234.py 2

Fig. 6 is generated executing file 'codefig6.py'.

Fig. 7 is generated executing file 'codefig7.py'.

Fig. 8 is generated executing file 'codefig8.py'.

Table 1 is generated executing file 'codetab1.py'.

Please note that the code is not generally perfected for performance, but is rather meant to illustrate certain results from the paper. The code is provided as-is without guarantees.
